# Address Extraction Tool

**Project Overview**

The Address Extraction Using AI Models project aims to revolutionize the process of extracting addresses from PDF documents. By harnessing the power of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models, we sought to enhance accuracy and efficiency in data extraction, reducing the need for manual intervention.'

**Goal**

Our primary objective was to develop an AI model capable of accurately extracting addresses from diverse textual datasets found in PDF documents. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models such as Mistral 7B and Large Language Models (LLMs), we aimed to demonstrate practical applications for automated address extraction, offering seamless integration into real-world scenarios.

**Functionality**

We spearheaded the development of a bespoke AI model tailored specifically for address extraction. Our approach involved:

  1. Training with Mistral 7B: Leveraging the formidable capabilities of Mistral 7B, an advanced language model, to understand and extract address information from textual data.
  2. Utilization of LLMs: Incorporating Large Language Models to enhance the model's ability to recognize and extract addresses accurately across diverse datasets.

**Impact**

The success of this initiative marked significant progress in the realm of automated address extraction from PDF documents. Key outcomes include:

  1. Enhanced Accuracy: Our AI model demonstrated superior accuracy in extracting addresses, surpassing traditional manual extraction methods.
  2. Efficiency Gains: By automating the extraction process, we enabled organizations to streamline their data extraction workflows, resulting in substantial time and cost savings.
  3. Real-world Applications: The developed model holds promise for driving efficiency and precision in industries reliant on accurate data extraction processes, such as finance, legal, and logistics.

**How to Use**

  1. Navigate to User Interface: Access the user interface of our address extraction tool.
  2. Select Document: Choose the PDF document containing the addresses you wish to extract from your local storage or cloud storage.
  3. Provide Metadata JSON File: Upload the corresponding JSON file containing essential metadata associated with the document, ensuring accurate extraction.
  4. Initiate Extraction: Click the "Upload" button to start the extraction process. Our system will seamlessly process the document and metadata in the background.
  5. View Extracted Data: Once the extraction is complete, the user interface will display a table containing the extracted addresses, organized in a structured format for easy review and analysis.
